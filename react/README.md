# React notes


[Notes from Pluralsight React course](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=react-big-picture&author=cory-house&name=e20fe73e-099f-4a1d-86a4-0077e941b3ac&clip=4)

React is  Library rather than a framework like Angular/Ember

React is lightwieight (35K)

Makes use of JS to create fake HTML rather than HTML to create fake JS Framework specific Syntax (Vue/Ember) - good if you already know JS



__Seperation of concerns:__

Traditioanl WebApps use MVC
*	Model - JS
*	View - HTML
*	Controller - JS

React - all (logic & markup) in same file:
*	JS
*	JSX

Also instead of 3 diff files for CSS, JS and HTML for your website, a React component file would have:
*   CSS
*   JS
*   HTML
	all in the same file, rather than 3 diff files


Break a page down into small components that are self containted and that you can reason about and test.

Build Step is typically required to convert many JS files created using ES2016 or JSX syntax files (i.e. facebook's create-react-app bootstrapper) into a format to be served to the browsers.
'''
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app counter-cliker

Maintain state - can use a number of options:
* Plain React
* Flux
* Redux
* MobX

One potential philosphy: â€œuse functions for simple components and use classes for managing state.

Notes:
OB: Server Side Rendering of HTML.
