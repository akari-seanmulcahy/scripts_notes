React is  Library rather than a framework like Angular/Ember
React is lightwieight (35K)
Makes use of JS to create fake HTML rather than HTML to create fake JS Framework specific Syntax (Vue/Ember) - good if you already know JS

Traditioanl WebApps use MVC
	Model - JS
	View - HTML
	Controller - JS
React - all (logic & markup) in same file:
	JS
	JSX

Seperation of concerns:
Also instead of 3 diff files for CSS, JS and HTML for your website, a React component file would have:
	- CSS
	- JS
	- HTML
	all in the same file, rather than 3 diff files
Break a page down into small components that are self containted and that you can reason about and test.

Build Step is typically required

Maintain state, can use a number of options:
- Plain React
- Flux
- Redux
- MobX

Notes:
OB: Server Side Rendering of HTML.
